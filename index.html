					<h3>Cybersecurity</h3>
					<h4 class="subtitle">What does it do?</h4>
					<p>Cybersecurity means that the software and hardware of the data in the system and the network system are saved from being leaked, changed, or damaged by unexpected or vicious reasons. With a tried and continuous operation of the network service and the system can not be broken down. </p>
					<p>Network firewall technology is a particular interconnection network equipment, which is used to enhance the access control between networks, hinder the users of the outer network from iniquitously entering the internal network through the external network, access to the internal network resources, and protect the internal network operating environment. It checks packets transmitted between two or more networks, such as link patterns, according to inevitable security policies, to decide if the telecommunications between networks is allowed or not, and invigilators the working state of the network.</p>
					<p>At present, the firewall products mainly include fortress host, packet filter router,
						application layer gateway, circuit layer gateway, shielding host firewall, dual host, etc.
						Anti-virus software is definitely the most widely used security technology solution because the technology is the easiest to implement, but we all know is the main function of antivirus software antivirus, the function is very limited, can not fully meet the needs of network security, this way maybe can meet the needs of individuals or small businesses, but if individuals or businesses have the demand of electronic commerce, It can't be completely satisfied.
						</p>
					<p>Fortunately, with the continuous development of anti-virus software technology, the current mainstream anti-virus software can prevent the Trojan horse and other hacker programs. Other antivirus software developers also provide a software firewall, with a certain firewall function, to a certain extent can play the role of a hardware firewall, such as KV300, Golden Mountain firewall, Norton firewall, and so on.</p>
					<p>The security technology used in combination with firewall includes file encryption and digital signature technology, its purpose is to improve the security and confidentiality of information systems and data. One of the primary technical means to prevent secret data from being stolen, intercepted, or destroyed by outsiders. With the development of information technology, people be more and more concentrate on network security and information confidentiality.</p>
					<p>At present, in accretion to enhancing data security safeguard in law and management, countries have also taken estimates in hardware and software technology respectively. It promotes the continuous improvement of data encryption skills and physical protection skills. According to the different functions, file encryption and digital signature technology basically include data transmission, data storage, data integrity discrimination, and so on.</p>
					<p>Artificial intelligence technology will be the focus of the next round of technological revolution. With the rapid development of AI and other technologies, the resulting security problems are more of a priority for our network security industry. Similar to artificial intelligence technology, blockchain is also listed as an important emerging technology. In the current network security industry, its two sides are very obvious. In contrast, the network defense of blockchain is also recognized in the industry, and it is reported that it is the second line of defense in the network security industry. The ensuing blockchain security, ecological security, information security, etc., have also become more obvious and complex. Its regulation has lagged behind the pace of development and has caused numerous safety problems. Quantum technology is now also threatening the security of traditional encryption algorithms. Quantum communication and quantum computing are the two most widely used technologies in the field of network security, and they are most closely related to network security. 5G technology has officially entered the commercial stage, and its network security threats will also be derived from new security technologies. The Internet of Things has been a safe disaster area. The complementary and coordinated development of cloud computing, edge computing, and fog computing will also have an impact on the security industry.</p>

					<h4 class="subtitle">What is the likely impact?</h4>
					<p>Cybersecurity is important because the amount of data that governments, the military, corporations, monetary and iatrical organizations gather in, store, and process on computers and other devices are unprecedented. A significant part of this data could be serious information, whether literary property, monetary data, personal detail, or other types of data, where illegal employment or reveal can have negative results. Companies transfer sensitive data over networks or other equipment in the course of their business, and cybersecurity describes the discipline of defending that data and the systems used to process or store it. As the scale and complexity of cyber hacking increase, organizations and companies, peculiarly those reliable for protecting data related to national security, medical, or monetary archives, need to take action to secure their sensitive commerce and individual information. America's top intelligence staff have warned that cyber strikes and electronic espionage are the most serious intimidation to state security, eclipsing even terrorism.</p>
					<p>New technologies in the cybersecurity industry are either research in nature, national strategy, or market-driven. These three pieces should be the main source of driving force for new technologies in network security.</p>
					<p>In terms of the nature of research, the vulnerability research technologies and methods at the system level emerge in an endless stream. With the iteration of versions and the update of hardware technology, many new injection reverse methods and vulnerability mining technologies have emerged from the traditional Windows to iOS and Android.</p>
					<p>From the perspective of national strategy, cyberspace confrontation and interference between countries will promote security methods and countermeasures at all levels from terminals to networks to systems to tools, as well as new ideas and technologies such as DNS pollution, BGP hijacking, and software intrusion.</p>
					<p>Driven from the market, is the apparent compliance and forced to promote market-oriented domestic technical generation and development, compliance-driven from a full business chain from upstream to downstream, the technology is accurate for the security services technology, technology itself is not necessarily the security, the security of the code is most concerned about, market behavior is more meet compliance requirements, At the same time, as far as possible to their problems, so, from code static to business dynamic self-protection and other related to the user business, in the confrontation has been developing.</p>

					<h4 class="subtitle">How will this affect you?</h4>
					<p>While work-at-home attacks are not a new threat, it is only a matter of time before an attacker can infiltrate multiple, insecure home networks simultaneously, wreaking havoc on critical systems and services. It makes sense. With many employees using their home broadband connections for personal and work purposes, the scope for corporate attacks has increased considerably.</p>
					<p>Data reveals can contain economic information such as credit card numbers or bank account details, personal health detail, individually identifiable information, trade secrets, intellectual property. Other ways for data breach include unintentional, data breach, cloud breach, information breach.</p>
					<p>When we join a public Wi-Fi, we usually reveal the risk of stealing personal detail from an external source. For example, some hackers on the network are able to access our devices to grab our personal detail. They range from so-called "man-in-the-middle" attacks to attacks that create bogus Wi-Fi to collect data. In what is known as a "man-in-the-middle" attack, the connection between a user and a Wi-Fi will be hackers broken to steal private information. While the fake Wi-Fi networks are ones that hackers create, they will look really alike to a reasonable connection.</p>
					<p>Those hackers have access to reasonable names for Wi-Fi networks that look like what a business network would connect. For example, when the actual name of the network is "Starbucks Guest," they may set a name like "Starbucks Guest."Hackers could use these networks to collect illegal data from those people who connect this connection.	</p>
