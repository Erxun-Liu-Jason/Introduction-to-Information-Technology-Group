				As our personal profiles show, Yiwei and Ruilin are more introverted. In group, they are more likely to
				be obedient.
				Erxun and Haonan act more active in the group. They always share their opinions about the topic and
				ready to help other
				members. They would be a bond to connect every members in order to work more effectively in the group.
				From Lanbo’s Big
				Five Personality test, she gets high score in Conscientiousness. In the group, Lanbo acts as a leader.
				She organizes
				group members to work together. We all have different personalities in the group, but we are also
				complementary which is
				the core factor of being an excellent group.
