						Problem needs to be solved
					</h1>
					<p> 
						In present days, the main problem has become to have access to 
						food during the pandemic of Covid 19. At this point, people are 
						struggling between the second wave of COVID-19 where citizens 
						are being more cautious about stepping out of their house. While
						people are maintaining social distancing by a large extent, 
						there are certain cases where people are needed to go outside 
						to acquire food. At that point of time, they can be in contact 
						with this virus. In this case, the global economy is deteriorating 
						significantly and restaurant industry in the country of Australia 
						is facing a great loss. Therefore it is the responsibility of Australians 
						to save its economy. In this proper solution to this problem is needed.
					</p>
					<h1>
						Overview
					</h1>
					<p>
						In order to recover from this situation, smartphone applications for food 
						ordering can be developed through which the restaurant can update its 
						traditional menu ordering system with a smart menu ordering system 
						(Cha and Seo, 2020). In this manner, the users or the guests who 
						are coming to the restaurant do not have to touch their mem card which 
						can contain COVID virus. At this point, this application can assist the 
						restaurants to embrace zero-contact service to people of Australia for 
						combatting this deadly pandemic. 
					</p>
					<h1>
						Motivation 
					</h1>
					<p>
						It is fortunate that Australia country is one the verge of being in a better 
						position, whereas the other countries are facing the second wave. At this 
						point, people of this country still need to take precautions carefully in 
						order to avoid the extensive spread of this pandemic. At this point, digital 
						innovation is that particular aspect which can assist people in maintaining 
						social distance from each other. In this regard, digital menu ordering systems 
						can help them in adhering to co contact principles throughout the pandemic. 
						In addition to this, people can take control of their activities while going 
						out to any restaurants.  
					</p>
					<h1>
						Target market
					</h1>
					<p>
						After severe consequences of COVID-19, people have started going out again. 
						In this case, the main target market for this application is mostly people 
						of Australia who are eager to eat any restaurant while following precautionary 
						measures for obstructing the spread of COVID-19. Under the circumstances, place 
						demographic attributes can be considered as the main target since people of 
						any age and employment status or any other aspects can come to restaurants. 
						In addition to this, the other customer  group can be identified as a target 
						market who have a smartphone. Since the entire project revolves around smartphones, 
						so people of Australia with smartphones can be a greater target market for 
						this application.   
					</p>
					<h1>
						Technical specification 
					</h1>
					<h4>
						Hardware requirements
					</h4>
					<p>
						There are external hardware devices can be utilized in this proposed application. 
						Two mobile phones and a computer must be used for the proceeding of this application 
						related to the restaurant menu ordering system. Each of the devices should be immune 
						to COVID-19 spread and proper caution must be used while operating these devices. 
						The smartphones will be used for two end user requirements (core.ac.uk, 2021). The 
						first one can be used by the users or the guests who will be coming to the restaurants.  
						And, the other one will be used from the restaurant side in order to take orders and 
						other attributes. In this case, computer system will be used as one back end server 
						which can store the application databases and back-end program of the application. 
						Therefore, it is mandatory that the information will be stored only in the computer 
						server not in those two smartphones. 
					</p>
					<h4>
						Software requirements 
					</h4>
					<p>
						For designing the interface of this ordering application, MIT App Inventor can be used. 
						Certain development languages are required for designing the background program for this 
						application. In this case, python or java can be effective. APII interface design along 
						with database applications, database software libraries such as SQLite must be utilized 
						for backend programming of this menu ordering application. Python can be used for managing 
						databases including storing user information (Bhargave et al., 2013). For this advanced 
						application, user information can include user details, login credentials, restaurant 
						menus and so on. Furthermore, encryption mechanisms must be used for encrypting personal 
						information of users along with password encryption. In this regard, RSA algorithm can be 
						used for the effectiveness of this application. 
					</p>
					<h4>
						Skill requirements
					</h4>
					<p>
						Extensive knowledge about programming languages such as python or java  must be acquired 
						for developing source code for this menu ordering  application for restaurants. Furthermore, 
						several aspects of API and database management system plus query language must be known for 
						proper development of this application. In case of API, the functions of an API such as Google 
						Map API must be known for designing this independently. Database management system knowledge 
						can help in carrying out  activities related to database engines such as SQLite. Encryption 
						technologies should also be covered for encrypting personal user information for this application.
					</p>
					<h1>
						Description 
					</h1>
					<h4>
						User application 
					</h4>
					<p>
						Initially user registration or user login page must be developed so that users can have access to 
						their individual private account for the restaurants. For this, user information like user name, 
						address, phone number must be put into the system. Although these private information are collected, 
						the data will be stored in a database server through encryption technology for security purposes. 
						If the user is frequent in any restaurant then the user preference will also be stored along with 
						recommended menu items making it easy for the users to order (Patil et al., 2017). After selecting 
						the restaurant they have gone to, they can see dinning time, number of people who are dining in so 
						that they can make a choice of whether they desire to eat  at that restaurant or not. Customer rating 
						facilities must be added  in this application for other customers to know about the protocols of 
						restaurants. Since, there can be several restaurants, a particular sort index must be added which 
						can show a range of restaurants based on service rank, business hours, score and current distance. 
						In case the users need assistance during their meal they can also call waiter from the waiter service 
						function designed for providing real time communication facilities.

					<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 14px">(Source: irjet.net, 2021)</p>
					<h4>
						Restaurant side application 
					</h4>
					<p>
						From restaurant side application, the login interface must be designed for the restaurants. Logging 
						into their personal accounts, restaurants can edit its contact number, address, number of people currently 
						dining, maximum number of people, business hours, menu orders and additional information (iaetsdjaras, 2021). 
						Through Google Map API the restaurants can add their address and directions to get their. Additionally, restaurants 
						can display its introduction along with its signature dishes, the number of customers who are in line and the 
						hygiene protocols followed by the restaurants for the customers who are inclined towards avoiding contact with 
						anyone. Menu options can present options based on different filters and sorting procedures such as lower price 
						first or higher price first. Furthermore for frequent customers their previously ordered items can additionally 
						be present there. Dishes ordering based on different flavors can also be generated for accessibility of customers. 
					</p>
					<h4>
						Payment application
					</h4>
					<p>
						Online payment application modules can reduce human touch to a large extent because of cashless transactions. 
						In payment application, relevant API functionalities of banks must be obtained. At this point, bank details 
						of the users must be collected for initiating transactions (Li et al., 2020). After completing the transaction 
						from the bank side, an automated bill must be generated. This bill information will be stored by both 
						customer end and restaurant end.      
					</p>
					<h1>
						Outcome
					</h1>
					<p>
						This developed smartphone restaurant menu ordering system can improve the traditional ordering system which is prone 
						to human contact because of high dependence upon paper based processes (Munene and Kasamani, 2018). The concerned 
						solution can assist the customers in ordering their foods at any restaurants at their basic comfort while reducing 
						human contact due to transaction bills, menu cards and other aspects. Furthermore the customers can be able to know 
						about restaurants’ current business timing, customer gatherings in order to avoid larger gatherings which can spread 
						COVID 19. The implementation technologies such as DBMS, SQLite, Python, Java and API can provide technical advancement 
						to menu ordering systems which can follow the basic rule of COVID19 precaution such as social distancing. Therefore, 
						it can be conjectured that this application can provide customers who are particularly concerned about their restaurant 
						choices during this pandemic. Therefore the safety ratings, business conditions and other attributes can assist customers 
						in making suitable restaurant choices.
					</p>
					<h1>
						Feasibility of project
					</h1>
					<p>
						This menu ordering application can attest to development of current customer trends towards, real-time and convenient 
						technological innovation. In this case, the menu ordering system through smartphones can substitute the utilization of paper 
						which is inconvenient and critical in present COVID 19 circumstances (Aulia et al., 2017). Through this application, both 
						customers and restaurants can be benefited in their respective context such as dining in a safe restaurant and improving 
						business productivity.

						In case the users need assistance during their meal they can also call waiter from the waiter service 
						function designed for providing real time communication facilities.

					<h4>
						Restaurant side application 
					</h4>
					<p>
						From restaurant side application, the login interface must be designed for the restaurants. Logging 
						into their personal accounts, restaurants can edit its contact number, address, number of people currently 
						dining, maximum number of people, business hours, menu orders and additional information (iaetsdjaras, 2021). 
						Through Google Map API the restaurants can add their address and directions to get their. Additionally, restaurants 
						can display its introduction along with its signature dishes, the number of customers who are in line and the 
						hygiene protocols followed by the restaurants for the customers who are inclined towards avoiding contact with 
						anyone. Menu options can present options based on different filters and sorting procedures such as lower price 
						first or higher price first. Furthermore for frequent customers their previously ordered items can additionally 
						be present there. Dishes ordering based on different flavors can also be generated for accessibility of customers. 
					</p>
					<h4>
						Payment application
					</h4>
					<p>
						Online payment application modules can reduce human touch to a large extent because of cashless transactions. 
						In payment application, relevant API functionalities of banks must be obtained. At this point, bank details 
						of the users must be collected for initiating transactions (Li et al., 2020). After completing the transaction 
						from the bank side, an automated bill must be generated. This bill information will be stored by both 
						customer end and restaurant end.      
					</p>
					<h1>
						Outcome
					</h1>
					<p>
						This developed smartphone restaurant menu ordering system can improve the traditional ordering system which is prone 
						to human contact because of high dependence upon paper based processes (Munene and Kasamani, 2018). The concerned 
						solution can assist the customers in ordering their foods at any restaurants at their basic comfort while reducing 
						human contact due to transaction bills, menu cards and other aspects. Furthermore the customers can be able to know 
						about restaurants’ current business timing, customer gatherings in order to avoid larger gatherings which can spread 
						COVID 19. The implementation technologies such as DBMS, SQLite, Python, Java and API can provide technical advancement 
						to menu ordering systems which can follow the basic rule of COVID19 precaution such as social distancing. Therefore, 
						it can be conjectured that this application can provide customers who are particularly concerned about their restaurant 
						choices during this pandemic. Therefore the safety ratings, business conditions and other attributes can assist customers 
						in making suitable restaurant choices.
					</p>
					<h1>
						Feasibility of project
					</h1>
					<p>
						This menu ordering application can attest to development of current customer trends towards, real-time and convenient 
						technological innovation. In this case, the menu ordering system through smartphones can substitute the utilization of paper 
						which is inconvenient and critical in present COVID 19 circumstances (Aulia et al., 2017). Through this application, both 
						customers and restaurants can be benefited in their respective context such as dining in a safe restaurant and improving 
						business productivity.
