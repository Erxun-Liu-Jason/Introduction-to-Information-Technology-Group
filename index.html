					<h3>Cybersecurity</h3>
					<h4 class="subtitle">What does it do?</h4>
					<p>Cybersecurity means that the software and hardware of the data in the system and the network system are saved from being leaked, changed, or damaged by unexpected or vicious reasons. With a tried and continuous operation of the network service and the system can not be broken down. </p>
					<p>Network firewall technology is a particular interconnection network equipment, which is used to enhance the access control between networks, hinder the users of the outer network from iniquitously entering the internal network through the external network, access to the internal network resources, and protect the internal network operating environment. It checks packets transmitted between two or more networks, such as link patterns, according to inevitable security policies, to decide if the telecommunications between networks is allowed or not, and invigilators the working state of the network.</p>
					<p>At present, the firewall products mainly include fortress host, packet filter router,
						application layer gateway, circuit layer gateway, shielding host firewall, dual host, etc.
						Anti-virus software is definitely the most widely used security technology solution because the technology is the easiest to implement, but we all know is the main function of antivirus software antivirus, the function is very limited, can not fully meet the needs of network security, this way maybe can meet the needs of individuals or small businesses, but if individuals or businesses have the demand of electronic commerce, It can't be completely satisfied.
						</p>
					<p>Fortunately, with the continuous development of anti-virus software technology, the current mainstream anti-virus software can prevent the Trojan horse and other hacker programs. Other antivirus software developers also provide a software firewall, with a certain firewall function, to a certain extent can play the role of a hardware firewall, such as KV300, Golden Mountain firewall, Norton firewall, and so on.</p>
					<p>The security technology used in combination with firewall includes file encryption and digital signature technology, its purpose is to improve the security and confidentiality of information systems and data. One of the primary technical means to prevent secret data from being stolen, intercepted, or destroyed by outsiders. With the development of information technology, people be more and more concentrate on network security and information confidentiality.</p>
					<p>At present, in accretion to enhancing data security safeguard in law and management, countries have also taken estimates in hardware and software technology respectively. It promotes the continuous improvement of data encryption skills and physical protection skills. According to the different functions, file encryption and digital signature technology basically include data transmission, data storage, data integrity discrimination, and so on.</p>
					<p>Artificial intelligence technology will be the focus of the next round of technological revolution. With the rapid development of AI and other technologies, the resulting security problems are more of a priority for our network security industry. Similar to artificial intelligence technology, blockchain is also listed as an important emerging technology. In the current network security industry, its two sides are very obvious. In contrast, the network defense of blockchain is also recognized in the industry, and it is reported that it is the second line of defense in the network security industry. The ensuing blockchain security, ecological security, information security, etc., have also become more obvious and complex. Its regulation has lagged behind the pace of development and has caused numerous safety problems. Quantum technology is now also threatening the security of traditional encryption algorithms. Quantum communication and quantum computing are the two most widely used technologies in the field of network security, and they are most closely related to network security. 5G technology has officially entered the commercial stage, and its network security threats will also be derived from new security technologies. The Internet of Things has been a safe disaster area. The complementary and coordinated development of cloud computing, edge computing, and fog computing will also have an impact on the security industry.</p>

					<h4 class="subtitle">What is the likely impact?</h4>
					<p>Cybersecurity is important because the amount of data that governments, the military, corporations, monetary and iatrical organizations gather in, store, and process on computers and other devices are unprecedented. A significant part of this data could be serious information, whether literary property, monetary data, personal detail, or other types of data, where illegal employment or reveal can have negative results. Companies transfer sensitive data over networks or other equipment in the course of their business, and cybersecurity describes the discipline of defending that data and the systems used to process or store it. As the scale and complexity of cyber hacking increase, organizations and companies, peculiarly those reliable for protecting data related to national security, medical, or monetary archives, need to take action to secure their sensitive commerce and individual information. America's top intelligence staff have warned that cyber strikes and electronic espionage are the most serious intimidation to state security, eclipsing even terrorism.</p>
					<p>New technologies in the cybersecurity industry are either research in nature, national strategy, or market-driven. These three pieces should be the main source of driving force for new technologies in network security.</p>
					<p>In terms of the nature of research, the vulnerability research technologies and methods at the system level emerge in an endless stream. With the iteration of versions and the update of hardware technology, many new injection reverse methods and vulnerability mining technologies have emerged from the traditional Windows to iOS and Android.</p>
					<p>From the perspective of national strategy, cyberspace confrontation and interference between countries will promote security methods and countermeasures at all levels from terminals to networks to systems to tools, as well as new ideas and technologies such as DNS pollution, BGP hijacking, and software intrusion.</p>
					<p>Driven from the market, is the apparent compliance and forced to promote market-oriented domestic technical generation and development, compliance-driven from a full business chain from upstream to downstream, the technology is accurate for the security services technology, technology itself is not necessarily the security, the security of the code is most concerned about, market behavior is more meet compliance requirements, At the same time, as far as possible to their problems, so, from code static to business dynamic self-protection and other related to the user business, in the confrontation has been developing.</p>

					<h4 class="subtitle">How will this affect you?</h4>
					<p>While work-at-home attacks are not a new threat, it is only a matter of time before an attacker can infiltrate multiple, insecure home networks simultaneously, wreaking havoc on critical systems and services. It makes sense. With many employees using their home broadband connections for personal and work purposes, the scope for corporate attacks has increased considerably.</p>
					<p>Data reveals can contain economic information such as credit card numbers or bank account details, personal health detail, individually identifiable information, trade secrets, intellectual property. Other ways for data breach include unintentional, data breach, cloud breach, information breach.</p>
					<p>When we join a public Wi-Fi, we usually reveal the risk of stealing personal detail from an external source. For example, some hackers on the network are able to access our devices to grab our personal detail. They range from so-called "man-in-the-middle" attacks to attacks that create bogus Wi-Fi to collect data. In what is known as a "man-in-the-middle" attack, the connection between a user and a Wi-Fi will be hackers broken to steal private information. While the fake Wi-Fi networks are ones that hackers create, they will look really alike to a reasonable connection.</p>
					<p>Those hackers have access to reasonable names for Wi-Fi networks that look like what a business network would connect. For example, when the actual name of the network is "Starbucks Guest," they may set a name like "Starbucks Guest."Hackers could use these networks to collect illegal data from those people who connect this connection.	</p>

						Problem needs to be solved
					</h1>
					<p> 
						In present days, the main problem has become to have access to 
						food during the pandemic of Covid 19. At this point, people are 
						struggling between the second wave of COVID-19 where citizens 
						are being more cautious about stepping out of their house. While
						people are maintaining social distancing by a large extent, 
						there are certain cases where people are needed to go outside 
						to acquire food. At that point of time, they can be in contact 
						with this virus. In this case, the global economy is deteriorating 
						significantly and restaurant industry in the country of Australia 
						is facing a great loss. Therefore it is the responsibility of Australians 
						to save its economy. In this proper solution to this problem is needed.
					</p>
					<h1>
						Overview
					</h1>
					<p>
						In order to recover from this situation, smartphone applications for food 
						ordering can be developed through which the restaurant can update its 
						traditional menu ordering system with a smart menu ordering system 
						(Cha and Seo, 2020). In this manner, the users or the guests who 
						are coming to the restaurant do not have to touch their mem card which 
						can contain COVID virus. At this point, this application can assist the 
						restaurants to embrace zero-contact service to people of Australia for 
						combatting this deadly pandemic. 
					</p>
					<h1>
						Motivation 
					</h1>
					<p>
						It is fortunate that Australia country is one the verge of being in a better 
						position, whereas the other countries are facing the second wave. At this 
						point, people of this country still need to take precautions carefully in 
						order to avoid the extensive spread of this pandemic. At this point, digital 
						innovation is that particular aspect which can assist people in maintaining 
						social distance from each other. In this regard, digital menu ordering systems 
						can help them in adhering to co contact principles throughout the pandemic. 
						In addition to this, people can take control of their activities while going 
						out to any restaurants.  
					</p>
					<h1>
						Target market
					</h1>
					<p>
						After severe consequences of COVID-19, people have started going out again. 
						In this case, the main target market for this application is mostly people 
						of Australia who are eager to eat any restaurant while following precautionary 
						measures for obstructing the spread of COVID-19. Under the circumstances, place 
						demographic attributes can be considered as the main target since people of 
						any age and employment status or any other aspects can come to restaurants. 
						In addition to this, the other customer  group can be identified as a target 
						market who have a smartphone. Since the entire project revolves around smartphones, 
						so people of Australia with smartphones can be a greater target market for 
						this application.   
					</p>
					<h1>
						Technical specification 
					</h1>
					<h4>
						Hardware requirements
					</h4>
					<p>
						There are external hardware devices can be utilized in this proposed application. 
						Two mobile phones and a computer must be used for the proceeding of this application 
						related to the restaurant menu ordering system. Each of the devices should be immune 
						to COVID-19 spread and proper caution must be used while operating these devices. 
						The smartphones will be used for two end user requirements (core.ac.uk, 2021). The 
						first one can be used by the users or the guests who will be coming to the restaurants.  
						And, the other one will be used from the restaurant side in order to take orders and 
						other attributes. In this case, computer system will be used as one back end server 
						which can store the application databases and back-end program of the application. 
						Therefore, it is mandatory that the information will be stored only in the computer 
						server not in those two smartphones. 
					</p>
					<h4>
						Software requirements 
					</h4>
					<p>
						For designing the interface of this ordering application, MIT App Inventor can be used. 
						Certain development languages are required for designing the background program for this 
						application. In this case, python or java can be effective. APII interface design along 
						with database applications, database software libraries such as SQLite must be utilized 
						for backend programming of this menu ordering application. Python can be used for managing 
						databases including storing user information (Bhargave et al., 2013). For this advanced 
						application, user information can include user details, login credentials, restaurant 
						menus and so on. Furthermore, encryption mechanisms must be used for encrypting personal 
						information of users along with password encryption. In this regard, RSA algorithm can be 
						used for the effectiveness of this application. 
					</p>
					<h4>
						Skill requirements
					</h4>
					<p>
						Extensive knowledge about programming languages such as python or java  must be acquired 
						for developing source code for this menu ordering  application for restaurants. Furthermore, 
						several aspects of API and database management system plus query language must be known for 
						proper development of this application. In case of API, the functions of an API such as Google 
						Map API must be known for designing this independently. Database management system knowledge 
						can help in carrying out  activities related to database engines such as SQLite. Encryption 
						technologies should also be covered for encrypting personal user information for this application.
					</p>
					<h1>
						Description 
					</h1>
					<h4>
						User application 
					</h4>
					<p>
						Initially user registration or user login page must be developed so that users can have access to 
						their individual private account for the restaurants. For this, user information like user name, 
						address, phone number must be put into the system. Although these private information are collected, 
						the data will be stored in a database server through encryption technology for security purposes. 
						If the user is frequent in any restaurant then the user preference will also be stored along with 
						recommended menu items making it easy for the users to order (Patil et al., 2017). After selecting 
						the restaurant they have gone to, they can see dinning time, number of people who are dining in so 
						that they can make a choice of whether they desire to eat  at that restaurant or not. Customer rating 
						facilities must be added  in this application for other customers to know about the protocols of 
						restaurants. Since, there can be several restaurants, a particular sort index must be added which 
						can show a range of restaurants based on service rank, business hours, score and current distance. 
						In case the users need assistance during their meal they can also call waiter from the waiter service 
						function designed for providing real time communication facilities.

					<h4>
						Restaurant side application 
					</h4>
					<p>
						From restaurant side application, the login interface must be designed for the restaurants. Logging 
						into their personal accounts, restaurants can edit its contact number, address, number of people currently 
						dining, maximum number of people, business hours, menu orders and additional information (iaetsdjaras, 2021). 
						Through Google Map API the restaurants can add their address and directions to get their. Additionally, restaurants 
						can display its introduction along with its signature dishes, the number of customers who are in line and the 
						hygiene protocols followed by the restaurants for the customers who are inclined towards avoiding contact with 
						anyone. Menu options can present options based on different filters and sorting procedures such as lower price 
						first or higher price first. Furthermore for frequent customers their previously ordered items can additionally 
						be present there. Dishes ordering based on different flavors can also be generated for accessibility of customers. 
					</p>
					<h4>
						Payment application
					</h4>
					<p>
						Online payment application modules can reduce human touch to a large extent because of cashless transactions. 
						In payment application, relevant API functionalities of banks must be obtained. At this point, bank details 
						of the users must be collected for initiating transactions (Li et al., 2020). After completing the transaction 
						from the bank side, an automated bill must be generated. This bill information will be stored by both 
						customer end and restaurant end.      
					</p>
					<h1>
						Outcome
					</h1>
					<p>
						This developed smartphone restaurant menu ordering system can improve the traditional ordering system which is prone 
						to human contact because of high dependence upon paper based processes (Munene and Kasamani, 2018). The concerned 
						solution can assist the customers in ordering their foods at any restaurants at their basic comfort while reducing 
						human contact due to transaction bills, menu cards and other aspects. Furthermore the customers can be able to know 
						about restaurants’ current business timing, customer gatherings in order to avoid larger gatherings which can spread 
						COVID 19. The implementation technologies such as DBMS, SQLite, Python, Java and API can provide technical advancement 
						to menu ordering systems which can follow the basic rule of COVID19 precaution such as social distancing. Therefore, 
						it can be conjectured that this application can provide customers who are particularly concerned about their restaurant 
						choices during this pandemic. Therefore the safety ratings, business conditions and other attributes can assist customers 
						in making suitable restaurant choices.
					</p>
					<h1>
						Feasibility of project
					</h1>
					<p>
						This menu ordering application can attest to development of current customer trends towards, real-time and convenient 
						technological innovation. In this case, the menu ordering system through smartphones can substitute the utilization of paper 
						which is inconvenient and critical in present COVID 19 circumstances (Aulia et al., 2017). Through this application, both 
						customers and restaurants can be benefited in their respective context such as dining in a safe restaurant and improving 
						business productivity.
